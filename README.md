# Ronny Steez, also known as Joe7777, is a hacker and cyberpunk enthusiast with a passion for the Rust and C programming languages. 
## I am the creator of the infamous infarox27 virus and the innovative BlackShield-ID-IPS security system. My expertise in computer programming and hacking combined with my love for the cyberpunk culture have made me a legend in the underground world of technology. I am dedicated to using my skills for both disruption and protection, and I am always pushing the limits of what is possible in this ever-evolving digital landscape.
